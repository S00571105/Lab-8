## Executive Summary 
This section described various database models and allowed the opportunity to practice querying a database with SQL. In addition this section discussed key ethical and legal implications of information systems.

## Data, Information and Knowledge and Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
In comparing and contrasting data, information and knowledge it is important to understand data is the raw facts and maybe qualitative (descriptive) or quantitative (numeric). Whereby information is processed data that has context, relevance and purpose and  information involves the manipulation of raw data to obtain an indication of magnitude, trends, in patterns in the data for purpose. And knowledge is the area of human believes or perceptions about relationships among facts or concepts relevant to that area. In addition there is explicit knowledge that typically refers to knowledge that can be expressed into words or numbers and tacit knowledge includes insights and intuition that is difficult to transfer to another. And the final step to knowledge is wisdom; this is when a person combines their knowledge and experience to produce a deeper meaning to a topic.

### Relational Data
When creating a database for a small company and two tables you identify are: customers and orders, explained below is the primary key, relationship between customer and orders and foreign key.  The Customer table would include customer Id, Customer name,contact name,address, city, postal code and country.  And the second table customer order would include customer ID, customer name, order date, order number,order name, order unit and price.

#### Primary Key:
The primary key would be Customer id that is unique to both the customer and orders for each table in a relational database.

#### Relationship between customers and orders:
The relationship between the customers and orders would be the primary key Customer ID.

#### Foreign key of orders table:
And possible a foreign key in this example would be an Order number.

### Field Data Types
When defining fields in a database table it is important to give each field data a type. The reason this is important is because the data field type defines what functions can be performed and it also gives the field the proper amount of storage space. The field types are: Text: for storing non-numeric data that is brief, generally under 256 characters. The database designer can identify the maximum length of the text,Number: for storing numbers. There are usually a few different number types that can be selected, depending on how large the largest number will be,Boolean: a data type with only two possible values, such as 0 or 1, “true” or “false”, “yes” or “no”,Date/Time: a special form of the number data type that can be interpreted as a number or a time,Currency: a special form of the number data type that formats all values with a currency indicator and two decimal places,Paragraph Text: this data type allows for text longer than 256 characters andObject: this data type allows for the storage of data that cannot be entered via keyboard, such as an image or a music file.

### Big Data
Big data is the collection of data that is huge in volume, and growing exponential in time. It is data with so large size and complexity that none of the traditional data management tools can store it or process it efficiently. So big data is data with a large size. An example of big data would be the New York Stock Exchange.

#### Four "V"s of Big Data
The four V’s of big data are volume, variety, velocity and variability. Volume refers to the size of the data, variety refers to heterogeneous sources and data nature both structured and unstructured, velocity refers to the speed of generation of data and variability refers to the inconsistency which can be shown by data at times, that may interfere with the processing of data effectively.

#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
Technology driving the need for big data this is evident with the New York Stock Exchnage, Social Media, and Jet engines. Social Media along shows that five hundred plus terabytes of new data get ingested into databases of social media site Facebook every day. 

## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
SQL is a structured query language that is a basic lanquage for accessing and manipulating databases.

### RDBMS and SQL
An explanation of RDMS is it is a relational data base management system and is the basis for SQL and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB 32, Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft Access. The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables, this is how it relates to SQL and the purpose of SQL is to get the data you want.
